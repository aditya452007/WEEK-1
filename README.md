## Summary of Improvements and Further Recommendations

**Summary of Improvements:**

- **Clear Documentation:** Each cell now includes a markdown description, making the workflow transparent and easy to follow.
- **Efficient Imports:** Libraries are imported only once, reducing redundancy and improving notebook performance.
- **Stepwise Data Cleaning:** The data cleaning process is broken down into logical, well-documented steps, ensuring clarity and reproducibility.
- **Targeted Filtering:** Non-numeric and irrelevant data are systematically removed, improving data quality for analysis.
- **Consistent Handling of Missing Values:** Missing values are standardized and handled in multiple stages, resulting in a robust, clean dataset.
- **Feature Renaming:** Long variable names are replaced with concise, readable names, enhancing usability and code readability.
- **Data Reshaping and Merging:** The dataset is transformed into a long format and merged efficiently, facilitating advanced analysis.
- **Progressive Filtering:** Years and countries with insufficient data are filtered out, ensuring the final dataset is both comprehensive and reliable.
- **Transparency:** Each cleaning step reports the impact on data shape and missing values, providing full transparency.

**Further Recommendations for Improvement:**

- **Automated Data Validation:** Implement automated checks for data consistency and outlier detection.
- **Visualization:** Add exploratory data analysis (EDA) plots to visualize distributions and relationships between variables.
- **Parameterization:** Allow filtering thresholds (e.g., missing value limits) to be set as parameters for flexibility.
- **Pipeline Modularization:** Refactor the workflow into reusable functions or a pipeline for easier maintenance and scalability.
- **Version Control:** Integrate with version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate efficiently.
- **Performance Optimization:** For large datasets, consider using chunked processing or Dask for scalability.
- **Unit Testing:** Add assertions or tests to validate each cleaning step, ensuring data integrity throughout the workflow.
